# 🍽️ Online Food Delivery – SQL Project

A data-driven project that simulates a real-world online food delivery system using SQL. It includes schema design, data insertion, and insightful SQL queries to support business decisions in the food-tech industry.

---

## 📌 Project Objective

To **design and analyze** a scalable and normalized relational database for an online food delivery platform that:

- Stores customers, restaurants, menu items, and orders
- Executes business-driven SQL queries
- Produces visual insights for decision-making

## 🗃️ Database Tables

The project consists of **5 interrelated tables**:

| Table Name      | Description                                                                 |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `customers`      | Stores customer ID, name, email, city, and signup date                      |
| `restaurants`    | Contains restaurant details like name, city, and registration date          |
| `menu_items`     | Lists item names and prices offered by restaurants                          |
| `orders`         | Records each order placed with links to customer and restaurant             |
| `order_details`  | Contains item-wise quantity details for each order                          |

## 📊 Key Business Queries

Below are a few critical queries run for business insights:

### 1. Total Orders per City
```sql
SELECT r.city, COUNT(o.order_id) AS total_orders
FROM restaurants r
JOIN orders o ON r.restaurant_id = o.restaurant_id
GROUP BY r.city
ORDER BY total_orders DESC;
```

### 2. Revenue Generated by Each Food Item
```sql
SELECT m.item_name, SUM(m.price * od.quantity) AS Item_Revenue
FROM menu_items m
JOIN order_details od ON m.item_id = od.item_id
GROUP BY m.item_name
ORDER BY Item_Revenue DESC;
```

### 3. Top 5 Spending Customers
```sql
SELECT c.customer_id, c.customer_name, SUM(m.price * od.quantity) AS Total_Spending
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
JOIN order_details od ON o.order_id = od.order_id
JOIN menu_items m ON od.item_id = m.item_id
GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.customer_name
ORDER BY Total_Spending DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

### 4. Monthly Order Trends
```sql
SELECT MONTH(order_date) AS month_number, MONTHNAME(order_date) AS month_name, 
COUNT(order_id) AS monthly_orders
FROM orders
GROUP BY MONTH(order_date), MONTHNAME(order_date)
ORDER BY month_number;
```
